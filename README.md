# Task Manager Application

Welcome to our Task Manager application - a sleek and intuitive platform designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. This application is built using React for the frontend, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface, and Django Rest Framework for the backend, ensuring robust and scalable server-side logic.

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Easily add new tasks with detailed descriptions.
- **Task Viewing:** View all your tasks in a simple and organized manner.
- **Task Management:** Update the status of your tasks or delete them as needed.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Django Rest Framework
- **Database:** SQLite3 for lightweight and efficient data management.

## Project Structure

- `/frontend`: Contains all React components, styles, and the entry point (`index.js`) for the client-side application.
- `/backend`: Hosts the Django project including settings (`settings.py`), URL routes (`urls.py`), and WSGI/ASGI configurations for web server communication.
- `/backend/todo`: A Django app dedicated to managing todo tasks, including models (`models.py`), views (`views.py`), serializers (`serializers.py`), and admin configurations (`admin.py`).
- `db.sqlite3`: The SQLite database file storing application data.
- `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock`: Used to manage Python package dependencies.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend environments.

### Backend Setup
